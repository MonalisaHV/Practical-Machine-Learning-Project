## Background
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which participants performed barbell lifts using accelerometer data.

## Data
The training dataset consists of accelerometer measurements from the belt, arm, forearm, and dumbbell. The testing dataset contains 20 observations.

## Data Cleaning
Columns with missing values were removed and identifier variables were excluded from the analysis.

## Model
A Random Forest classification model was trained to predict the outcome variable `classe`.

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy and was used to generate predictions for the required test cases.

## Conclusion
Random Forest proved to be an effective method for this classification task.
